We are a machine intelligence research lab based on Johannesbgurg, South Africa. The lab is jointly organised by members of the School of Electrical and Electronic  Engineering at the University of Johannesburg and the School of Statistics and Actuarial Science at the University of Witwatersrand. Our foundational research areas include probabilistic machine learning, causal inference and computational finance. Our applied work spans artificial intelligence in energy, climate science and diverse social good applications. 

We are always keen on new team members and collaborations - please reach out!
